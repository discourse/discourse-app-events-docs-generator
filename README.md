# **Discourse AppEvents Docs Generator**

This library provides scripts for parsing a given directory for Discourse AppEvents triggers and arguments passed in, and generating documentation from that data.

1. Create a .env file and set DISCOURSE_CORE to the desired directory path to be parsed.

2. Run the script from root of this repo with node scripts/extract_app_events.mjs
